## Ranked: The Top 25 Countries for Retirement in 2024

### **Introduction:**
The Global Retirement Index by Natixis provides a comprehensive assessment of the well-being of retirees across various countries. It analyzes factors such as Health, Quality of Life, Material Wellbeing, and Finances in Retirement. The Index is a vital tool for understanding the economic and social conditions affecting the post-working life stage. It serves as a benchmark for nations to evaluate policies towards improving the welfare of their retired population. The Index is particularly insightful for individuals looking to choose a retirement destination.


### **Objective of the Project:**
The project aims to provide a detailed evaluation of retirement conditions in different countries and to understand the key drivers that make a country favorable for retirees. 
- To identify which countries offer the best healthcare and non-insured health expenditure for retirees.
- To evaluate the happiness index, air and water quality, sanitation, and biodiversity as components of the Quality of Life for retirees.
- To analyze Material Wellbeing by assessing per capita income, income equality, and unemployment rates in the context of retirees.
- To scrutinize Finances in Retirement by examining government debt, old-age dependency ratios, interest rates, inflation, tax burdens, and governance.
- To compare the overall scores and rankings of the top 25 countries for retirement.


### **About the Data:**
The data is compiled by Natixis, which analyzed 44 nations (including IMF advanced economies, OECD members, and BRICS countries) based on various categories affecting retirement. Each category contributes to an averaged score out of 100 to create the index. The data is presumably gathered from credible financial and social databases, health statistics, and environmental measures. Each category has subindices, from which they averaged scores out of 100 to create this ranking. The categories are:
- Health: Per capita spend on healthcare, life expectancy, and non-insured health spend.
- Quality of Life: Happiness levels, water and sanitation, air quality, environment, and biodiversity.
- Material Well-being: Per capita income, income equality, and employment levels.
- Retirement Finances: Government debt, old-age dependency, interest rates, inflation, governance, taxes, and bank non-performing loans.


### **Analyzing the Data:**
The dataset is visualized using information graphics, revealing insights into the best countries for retirement based on the combined scores of the four main categories. The analysis delves into the qualitative and quantitative aspects of each country, providing a multi-dimensional view of retiree welfare. The information can be further enhanced by cross-referencing with external economic and demographic datasets for a more in-depth understanding.


### **Conclusion:**
- The top-ranking nation for retirees, according to this analysis, is Norway. It excels, particularly in health and material well-being. During the pandemic, Norway stood out with an increase in life expectancy, now at an impressive 83.3 years, surpassing many nations where life expectancy has declined due to the pandemic's impact. Norway’s employment landscape is also robust, with a mere 3.8% unemployment rate, suggesting a strong social security system.
- The top four countries — Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, and Ireland — maintained their positions from the previous year's ranking, demonstrating consistency in their retirement conditions. Estonia also holds steady at the 25th spot, whereas other countries have shifted positions.
- Noteworthy within the top 25 is Australia, ranked seventh and the leading non-European country on the list, praised for its retirement finances backed by a substantial superannuation pension system.
- France, positioned just beyond the top 20, faced social upheavals due to a controversial decision to increase the retirement age to 64. This legislative change aims to extend work life, thus supporting the retirement system by increasing contributions and addressing the challenging old-age dependency ratio.
